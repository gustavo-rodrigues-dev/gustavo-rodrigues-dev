# Resume
*Tech Leader, Solutions Architect, Software Engineering*

> I'm Gustavo, I work with technology since 2010. I have worked in many positions throughout my career, especially as a solution architect and software engineer.
> 

I've had great experiences with **AWS**, like Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNQ, ECS, ECS, RDS, S3, Athena, Kinesis, and other technologies. I worked with **Google Cloud** too, but for no long time, where I was used GKE, AppEngine, Google Store, and Data Store.

My principal languages are **Javascript** and **Typescript**, where I worked on many projects, mainly using **Node** with Express, NestJs, socket.io, gRPC, and other technologies. Besides that, I've experienced with **PHP**, **Go**, and **Python**.

About Databases, I know NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, and **Redis** as a key-value DB. But I've experience with SQL too, especially **MySQL** (Maria DB, Aurora), but I used **Postgres** and **SQL Server**, and **Oracle 12g** too.

I have a strong base in **Event-Driven Architecture**, mainly using **Kafka** and **SNS**. Besides that, I have a long experience with **microservices**, especially for critical mass. I had used stream RPC-based services using **gRPC** for internal services and **REST** and **GraphQL** to resolve integration **gateway** with other clients and services.

In addition to my tech experience, I have a **leadership background as a technical leader** and **engineering manager**. My main role was to develop a **solid and anti-fragile technical team** with agile values and strong knowledge culture.

## 💻 Technology

### AWS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I have been working intensively for the last 5 years with projects that use AWS. I have been working mainly in the creation of consistent architectures following well-Architecture principles.

Within AWS, I have worked directly with EC2, ECS, and Lambda computing products, where I had the opportunity to create projects, implement monitoring and observability.

As for storage and database services, I have already used RDS as a consumer, but not for cluster administration; in addition, I have already worked with products such as Redis for Elastic Cache and OpenSearch for Elastic Cache, and I have also massively used S3, included as a Key-Value database, and in some analyzes with Athena.

As for queue, stream, and messaging services, I have already worked with SQS and SNS products, but I have also worked with an MSK cluster (Kafka) and Kinesis for data stream. I used some of these products directly to provide integrations with other internal services to reduce coupling, whether to attend BI area and process to creating data lake or for create message architecture.

I Have experience with CloudWatch for troubleshooting, like making custom queries to observe correlations with some indicators and making some alarms.

Since the end of last year, I have been studying the AWS CDK to reduce the boundary between the development team and the Ops team.

### Javascript/Typescript/Node ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over 10 years. I've used it in the back-end for APIs with Node (since 0.12 until 16), Express, Apolo GraphQL, Nest JS, Inversify JS, Loopback, gRPC-js, Socket.IO, TypeORM, Sequelize, Prisma, Mongose, and for testing automation using Mocha and later on, Jest.

### Python ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I possess extensive experience in developing APIs and automating tasks using Python, including proficiency with Flask for web development and Boto3 for AWS services interaction, among other libraries and tools.

### PHP ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

It was my first programming language that I've worked with, and I made projects with it for over 7 years. I've used it in many solutions for websites and systems, and I've used Laravel, Symfony, Cake PHP, and Diesel as Fullstack frameworks and Slim and Silex as microframeworks. I used too Doctrine 2 and Active Record as ORM and Ratchet to resolve Web Sockets. Furthermore, I used Drupal and WordPress as CMS, and I have also done a CMS for small businesses.
